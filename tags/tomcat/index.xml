      <description>I had the problem to start the Apache Tomcat as a daemon under a different user. After creating an RPM which puts the appropriate files into the correct location i had to create a service script to start, stop and check the status of the Tomcat daemon. The most important thing here is to have a su -l username which will go to the different user in his home folder where i can call the startup.</description>
