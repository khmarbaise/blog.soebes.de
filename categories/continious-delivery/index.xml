      <description>Based on todays requirements it is needed to do a continuous delivery of your artifacts by each change on your master (Git)/trunk(SVN). The question is what you need to achieve this with Maven?
Usually you are using so called SNAPSHOT versions which means your version looks like 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT and indicates that you are currently working towards the release version 1.2.3. Afterwards you continue with the next snapshot version like 1.2.4-SNAPSHOT and so on.</description>
