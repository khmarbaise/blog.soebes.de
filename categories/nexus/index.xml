      <description>Previously I was working on a Nexus Repository Manager setup for different environments like a test and a production environment with different privileges, roles, repositories, users etc.
The problem with such setups is simple: You usually do it manually which in consequence is error-prone. If you are doing that more than once, it becomes cumbersome and you are asking yourself: Isn&amp;rsquo;t there a simpler solution to make that setup more reproducible?</description>

      <description>Do you know how many downloads are done from Maven Central during a month? I was not aware of that as well. As a PMC member of the Apache Maven Project I have the privilege of having access to the statistics of Maven Central.
So I checked the statistics of Maven Central. I can tell you that in the groupId org.apache.maven were more than 27 million (28,933,147) downloads in April 2016.</description>
