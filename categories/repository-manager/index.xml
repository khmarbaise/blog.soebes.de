      <description>Do you know how many downloads are done from Maven Central during a month? I was not aware of that as well. As a PMC member of the Apache Maven Project I have the privilege of having access to the statistics of Maven Central.
So I checked the statistics of Maven Central. I can tell you that in the groupId org.apache.maven were more than 27 million (28,933,147) downloads in April 2016.</description>
