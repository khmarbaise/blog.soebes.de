I currently found an interesting [article](http://blog.activelylazy.co.uk/2012/01/03/enough-whitespace-already "Enough Whitespace")
about formatting of source code which considerably remarkable, cause it takes the point of view to readability which is 
very important in our days. That means in other words that our current IDE's are not good enough.
