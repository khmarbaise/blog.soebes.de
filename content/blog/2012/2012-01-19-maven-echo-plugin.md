A small problem, but always the suggestion to use Maven-AntRun plugin...But i changed it and created a small simple 
maven-plugin to solve that. The [Maven-Echo-Plugin](http://khmarbaise.github.io/Maven-Echo-Plugin/) which can be used 
to print out some informative messages during a Maven build...If you have any suggestions for improvements 
don't hesitate to contact me or just file in an issue on [github|(https://github.com/khmarbaise/Maven-Echo-Plugin").
