The Apache Maven team has started the VOTE for the first public releases 
of [Apache Maven JMod Plugin](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@maven.apache.org/msg114779.html)
 and the [Apache Maven JLink Plugin](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@maven.apache.org/msg114780.html).

If you have any feedback missing features, questions etc. please either open an issue in JIRA (references

Kind regards
Apache Maven Team.
