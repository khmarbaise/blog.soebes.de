The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven Surefire/Failsafe Plugin, version 2.18](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/).

The release contains a number of bug fixes, and introduces an option to
automatically rerun failing tests, including proper reporting on the
console and in the XML reports for the individual runs.
Again we received some much appreciated contributions from the community in
form of bug reports, bug fixes and patches for new features. Thank you and
keep 'em coming!
