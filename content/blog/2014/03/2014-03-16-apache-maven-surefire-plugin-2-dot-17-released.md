The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven Surefire Plugin, version 2.17](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)

This release comes with some smaller improvements and bug fixes for TestNG,
for the JUnit Parallel Computer, the removal of temporary files, and last
but not least it fixes a compatibility issue with JDK 8 - just in time for
the much anticipated GA this week.
Yet again we received some much appreciated contributions from the
community. Thank you and keep 'em coming!

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

``` xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.17</version>
</plugin>
```
