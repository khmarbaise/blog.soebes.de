The Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven PMD Plugin, version 3.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/)

A Maven plugin for the PMD toolkit, that produces a report on both code rule violations 
and detected copy and paste fragments, as well as being able to fail the build based on these metrics.


You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

``` xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.1</version>
</plugin>
```
