The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven Wagon, Version 2.6](http://maven.apache.org/wagon/)

The Wagon component provides communications between Maven and repositories.

Typically, to use a particular version of Wagon, you would add an
'extension' to your POM, such as:

``` xml
<extensions>
    <extension>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.wagon</groupId>
        <artifactId>wagon-ssh</artifactId>
        <version>2.6</version>
    </extension>
</extensions>
```
