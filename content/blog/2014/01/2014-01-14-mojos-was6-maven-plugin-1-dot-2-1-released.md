The Mojo team is pleased to announce the [release of the WAS6 Maven Plugin version 1.2.1](http://mojo.codehaus.org/was6-maven-plugin/).

to provide automated tasks for: generating RMIC stubs, starting/stopping servers, installing/updating/uninstalling 
EARs to application servers, starting/stopping application and run arbitrary scripts through wsadmin
