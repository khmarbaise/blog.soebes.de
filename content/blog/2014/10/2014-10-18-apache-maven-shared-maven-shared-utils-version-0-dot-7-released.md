The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Shared Component: Apache Maven Utils Version 0.7](https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-shared-utils/)

This project aims to be a functional replacement for plexus-utils in Maven. It
is not a 100% API compatible replacement though but a replacement with
improvements: lots of methods got cleaned up, generics got added and we dropped
a lot of unused code.
