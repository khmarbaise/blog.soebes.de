The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven SCM, version 1.9.1](https://maven.apache.org/scm/).

Maven SCM supports Maven 2.x plugins (e.g. maven-release-plugin) and other
tools (e.g. Continuum) by providing them with a common API for doing SCM
operations. You can look at the list of SCMs for more information on using
Maven SCM with your favorite SCM tool.

Improvement:

 * [SCM-741](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCM-741) - scm:validate for svn should offer a way to check the current directory actually matches what's declared in the pom

Tasks:

 * [SCM-756](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCM-756) - TCK should invoke EditCommand for provider like Perforce before any change
 * [SCM-760](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCM-760) - remove maven-scm-plugin's RemoveMojoTest due to specific Perforce setup requirement
 * [SCM-761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCM-761) - Allow downstream TCK to define its own tag

Enjoy,
