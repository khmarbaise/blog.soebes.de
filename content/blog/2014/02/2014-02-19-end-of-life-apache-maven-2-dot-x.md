The [Apache Maven Project Team](http://maven.apache.org/team-list.html) would like to inform you 
that the [Apache Maven 2.x](http://maven.apache.org/maven-2.x-eol.html) has reached its end of life 
and is no longer supported.

Apache Maven 2.x had its last release - version 2.2.1 - in November 2009.

This means:

 * security vulnerability reports will not be checked against the 2.x branch
 * the 2.x download pages will be removed.
 * the latest 2.x release will be removed from the mirror system
 * the links to any 2.x specific documentation will be moved to http://maven.apache.org/maven-2.x/

The Apache Maven Team.
