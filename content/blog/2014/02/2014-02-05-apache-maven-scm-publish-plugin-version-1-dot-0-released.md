The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven SCM Publish Plugin, version 1.0](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/)

The maven-scm-publish-plugin is a utility plugin to allow publishing Maven 
website to any supported SCM. The primary goal was to have an utility plugin 
to allow Apache projects to publish Maven websites via the ASF svnpubsub 
system. The plugin has been tested with git scm too and by example can push 
content for github pages.


You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</plugin>
```

a few seconds and retry

naturally linked to natural site lifecycle, and multi-module

The Apache Maven team
