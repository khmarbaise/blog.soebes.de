We have released a new version of the [`The Jenkins API client for Java`][1].
The new released 0.3.7 contains several bugfixes and new features.

This is the second release under the Jenkins Github Organization umbrella.

 * `Build` class offers now two different methods to get the 
   test informations. Using either `getTestResult()` for non maven type jobs or
   getTestReport() for maven type jobs.

 * New methods have been added to change the description of a job. The display name
   and/or the description of a build can be changed.

 * Added new helper class has been added to trigger a job wait until the job
   is finished.

 * All `build` methods of Job now consistently giving back a `QueueReference`.

 * Now you can request to get all builds back of a job which was not possible
   in previous releases.

The Jenkins API client for Java allows you to get informations about builds for example
the duration of a build or test report informations.
