Currently the preparations for the upcoming Maven 3.4.0 release is running. 
There had been [informations about the changes][change-1] for the next Maven 
release.

I will give some more information about changes which are (might be!) part of
the next [Maven release][jira-issues].

Just be warned that you do not blame me if a particular issue will not part of the final release.
This is written from the current perspecitve. So no warranty about that. 

I assume that you know [filtering in resources][maven-resources-filtering] can
simply be achieved by configuring things like this in your pom file:

```xml
  ...
  <resources>
    <resource>
      <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
      <filtering>true</filtering>
    </resource>
  </resources>
...
```

But this configuration has one drawback. It will filter everything, except
files with pre defined extensions like 
[`jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `bmp`, `png`][non-filtered-extensions]. 

Often in builds you need have supplemental files which should be filered or not
filtered. So the consequence is to enhance the configuration and adding
those extensions/folders etc. Or you know that you have some folders in that above
tree which contain files which should not be filtered eithers. This often ends
up with a bunch of includes/excludes etc. which is simply cumbersome.

The best and simplest solution would be having two different locations for filtered
and non-filtered files. So a configuration in your pom could look like this:

```xml
  ...
  <resources>
    <resource>
      <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
    </resource>
    <resource>
      <directory>src/main/filtered-resources</directory>
      <filtering>true</filtering>
    </resource>
  </resources>
...
```

So this setup makes it easier and more clean where the files are located which will be 
filtered and the ones which will not. The same could of course be applied to the 
`src/test` area.

By improving the `Conventions over Configuration` paradigm in 
Maven 3.4.0 the [super pom contains such an configuration][MNG-2478] for
the `src/main/resources`, `src/main/filtered-resources`, as well as for
the `src/test/resources`, `src/test/filtered-resources`.
