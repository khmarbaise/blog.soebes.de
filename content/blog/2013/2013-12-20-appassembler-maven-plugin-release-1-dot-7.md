The Mojo Team is pleased to announce the new release 
of the [Appassembler Maven Plugin 1.7](http://mojo.codehaus.org/appassembler/appassembler-maven-plugin/)
which contains a number of bug fixes, improvements and a new feature.

The Application Assembler Plugin is a Maven plugin for generating
scripts for starting java applications.
All dependencies and the artifact of the project itself are placed in
a generated Maven repository in a defined assemble directory.
All artifacts (dependencies + the artifact from the project) are added
to the classpath in the generated bin scripts.


You can use the following Maven coordinates to get the latest version via Maven Central:

``` xml
