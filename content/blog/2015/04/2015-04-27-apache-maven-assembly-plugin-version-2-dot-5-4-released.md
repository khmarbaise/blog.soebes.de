The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven Assembly Plugin, version 2.5.4](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/).

The Assembly Plugin for Maven is primarily intended to allow users to aggregate
the project output along with its dependencies, modules, site documentation,
and other files into a single distributable archive.

This release is mostly a bugfix release, but due to MASSEMBLY-764 we
also gained multithreaded ZIP compression, which should especially
benefit users with large zip files.

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

``` xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.5.4</version>
</plugin>
```
