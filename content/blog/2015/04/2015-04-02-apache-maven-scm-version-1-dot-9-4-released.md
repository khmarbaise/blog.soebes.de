The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven SCM, version 1.9.4](https://maven.apache.org/scm/).

Maven SCM supports Maven 2.x plugins (e.g. maven-release-plugin) and other
tools (e.g. Continuum) by providing them with a common API for doing SCM
operations. You can look at the list of SCMs for more information on using
Maven SCM with your favorite SCM tool.
