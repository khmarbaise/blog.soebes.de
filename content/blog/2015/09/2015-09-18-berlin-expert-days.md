I had the pleasure to do a talk on the [Berlin Expert Days][bedcon] about [Maven 3 and
beyond][1]. There had been many intersting questions about different Maven
aspects of Maven like the life cycle and about the the usage of different
features. For example the usable support of `${revision}` in [your pom file][3]
which can set via command line like the following:
```
mvn -Drevision=1.0-SNAPSHOT clean package
```

which seemed to be unknown. What me really astonished was that there had been
people who are still using Maven 2 where strongly recommended to migrate to
Maven 3. Furthermore there had been serveral interesting chats afterwards about
the usage of Maven etc. and best practices.

[So here are the slides of my talk as a PDF file.](/downloads/files/Maven3AndBeyond.pdf)
