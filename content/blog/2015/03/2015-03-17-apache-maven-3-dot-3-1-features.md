The new [Maven 3.3.1 Release is just out](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12316922&version=12330193).
Let us take a deeper look into the new features/improvements:

 * The first and most important thing is that [Maven 3.3.1 needs JDK 1.7][MNG-5780].

 * In our days it becomes more and more important to be able to use different JDK 
   to be used by Maven itself and which is used to compile/test your production code.
   This concept is know under the name [Toolchains][0] which is unfortunately not very 
   well-known.

   The handling of the [`toolchains.xml`][MNG-3891] file has been adjusted with the 
   handling of `settings.xml` which means it will be searched within the
   `${maven.home}/conf/` folder and furthermore within the `${user.home}/.m2/` folder.

   For a better understanding and as an example of the `toolchains.xml` file has been added
   to the [Maven distribution][MNG-5745].

   Maven has been improved to read the `toolchains.xml` file [during initialization][MNG-5754] instead
   of waiting till [maven-toolchains-plugin][maven-toolchains-plugin] will read it.


 * Core Extension mechanism has [been improved][MNG-5771] to make 
   it simpler to use.

   The old way (up to Maven 3.2.5) was to create a jar (must be shaded if you have other dependencies)
   which contains the extension and put it manually into the `${MAVEN_HOME}/lib/ext` folder. 
   This means you had to change the Maven installation. The consequence was that everyone who likes 
   to use this needed to change it's installation and makes the on-boarding for a developer much 
   more inconvenient. The other option was to give the path to the jar on command line via 
   `mvn -Dmaven.ext.class.path=extension.jar`. This has the drawback giving those
   options to your Maven build every time you are calling Maven. Not very convenient as well.
 
   From now on this can be done much more simpler and in a more Maven like way. So 
   you can define an `${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/extensions.xml` file which looks 
   like the following:

``` xml
<extensions xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/EXTENSIONS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/EXTENSIONS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/core-extensions-1.0.0.xsd">
  <extension>
    <groupId/>
    <artifactId/>
    <version/>
  </extension>
</extensions>
```

   Now you can simply use an extension by defining the usual maven coordinates
   `groupId`, `artifactId`, `version` as any other artifact. Furthermore all
   transitive dependencies of those extensions will automatically being downloaded
   from your repository. So no need to create a shaded artifact anymore.

   An other advantage is that the `${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/`
   directory is located in the root of your Maven project and in conseuqence
   is part of your project which means you will check it in along with
   your project. So everyone who checks out your project automatically
   can use the extensions.

   One thing is important that the extensions will be resolved from the
   pluginRepository. This is important if you have configured the pluginRepository
   different from the repository.

 * [Project specific jvm and command line otions][MNG-5767]

   It's really hard to define a general set of options for calling the maven
command line. Usually this will be solved by putting this options to a script
but this can now simple being done by defining
`${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/maven.config` file which contains the
configuration options for the command line. For example things like `-T3 -U
--fail-at-end`. So you only have to call maven just by using `mvn clean
package` instead of `mvn -T3 -U --fail-at-end clean package` and not to miss
the `-T3 -U --fail-at-end` options. The
`${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/maven.config` is located in the
`${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/` folder which is in the root of a multi module
build. This folder is part of the project and will be checked in into your
version control. This results in being picked by everybody who checks out the
project and no need to remember to call this project via `mvn -T3 -U
--fail-at-end clean package` instead of `mvn clean package`.


   In Maven it is not simple to define JVM configuration on a per project base.
The existing mechanism based on an environment variable `MAVEN_OPTS` and the
usage of `${user.home}/.mavenrc` is an other
option with the drawback of not being part of the project.

   Starting with this release you can define JVM configuration via
`${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/jvm.config` file which means you can define the
options for your build on a per project base. This file will become part of
your project and will be checked in along with your project. So no need anymore
for `MAVEN_OPTS`, `.mavenrc` files. So for example if you put the following JVM
options into the `${maven.projectBasedir}/.mvn/jvm.config` file

```
-Xmx2048m -Xms1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Djava.awt.headless=true
```

you don't need to remember of using this options in `MAVEN_OPTS` or switching
between different configurations.


 * Improvement for [Plugin Goal Invocation from command line][MNG-5768]

If you call a plugin directly from command line like the following:

```
mvn exec:java
```
The configuration which is used here can be defined in your pom by using an execution id `default-cli`.

```
<project...>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.3.2</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>default-cli</id>
            <configuration>
              <mainClass>com.soebes.test.First</mainClass>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins> 
  </build>
</project>
```

Starting with this Maven release you can now define several configuration for different
executions on command like the following:

```
<project...>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.3.2</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>default-cli</id>
            <configuration>
              <mainClass>com.soebes.test.First</mainClass>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
          <execution>
            <id>second-cli</id>
            <configuration>
              <mainClass>com.soebes.test.Second</mainClass>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins> 
  </build>
</project>
```

So if you like to use the configuration given with the execution id:
`second-cli` this can be done like this:

```
mvn exec:java@second-cli
```

So now you can define more than one configuration for command line executions.

   at long last. Yeah.
